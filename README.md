# C# WPF Chat Application

## Overview
This project is a simple chat application developed in C#, utilizing Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) for its user interface. It was created as an extension of a live coding teaching session for students who have completed their second course in C#. The main objective is to enhance the practical skills of learners by engaging them in real-world coding scenarios.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Enabling account creation and login functionality, demonstrating user data handling and session management in C#.
- **Live Chat Functionality**: Facilitating real-time messaging between users, providing experience with networking and asynchronous programming.
- **WPF-based UI**: Showcasing the design and management of user interface components in a desktop application.

## Educational Focus
This project is an invaluable tool for intermediate C# learners, offering:
- **Practical Implementation**: Bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world programming.
- **Code Understanding**: With commented and well-structured source code, it aids in learning and understanding the application's implementation.

## Getting Started
To engage with this project:
1. **Clone the Repository**: Get a local copy by cloning this repo.
2. **Prerequisites**: Ensure a C# development environment with access to WPF libraries is set up.
3. **Run the Application**: Compile and run the application in your IDE to see it in action.
4. **Explore and Experiment**: Dive into the codebase and experiment with it to grasp the nuances of a C# WPF application.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions, especially from students and educators. Your input in improving the code, adding features, or enhancing documentation is invaluable. 

## Acknowledgements
